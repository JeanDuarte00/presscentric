Thanks again for attending our interview - it was nice to chat with you!

Following up on the interview:

What  we would  like to request is something you probably already very
familiar  with  and saw this request quite a few times during your job
hunting: a simple test project.

Project requirements:

A small back-end app that exposes one GraphQL Entity with queries and
mutations for CRUD operation for a simple User object with the following
3 fields:

  - id
  - email
  - name

To speed things up and make them a bit easier: the prepared GraphQL schema
file is attached to this project description, which specs the objects
and lists all operations.

The tech specs/stack for the project:

  Framework: Spring Framework/Latest
  GQL:       DGS Framework
  DAO:       Hibernate/JPA for DAO layer
  Build:     We use/prefer gradle, but any buildable project would do

NOTES

No need for security or anything fancy for either project, but if you
want to show off and impress in any way - feel free to do so. :)

Make sure to document your application and mention how to run it.

Tests are nice to have.

A clean git commit timeline is a plus. We suggest Conventional Commits.

DELIVERY

The  preferred result is a project accompanied by a build script for a
build tool of your choice which results in the app's .WAR file, which
we can deploy and test (expected to run in tomcat 7+ container).

The preferred method of delivery is a GitHub repository, but an email with
a package would do just fine either.

Please confirm the receipt of this email, as they sometimes get lost.

If there are any questions about the assignment, you can reach out by

Looking forward to your submission!
